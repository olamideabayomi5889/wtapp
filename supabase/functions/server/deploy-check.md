# üö® Supabase 403 Deployment Error - Complete Fix Guide

## Quick Summary
Your WondasTeach app is **working perfectly** in offline mode! The 403 error is a Supabase deployment permissions issue, not a code problem. All features work with local data while you resolve this.

## The Error
```
Error while deploying: XHR for "/api/integrations/supabase/woO7tVLT1thaCA91b578RM/edge_functions/make-server/deploy" failed with status 403
```

## Problem
```
Error while deploying: XHR for "/api/integrations/supabase/woO7tVLT1thaCA91b578RM/edge_functions/make-server/deploy" failed with status 403
```

## Root Cause
This is a **permissions issue** with your Supabase project, not a code issue. The 403 Forbidden error means the deployment request is being rejected due to insufficient permissions.

## Solutions (Try in order)

### 1. Check Supabase Project Permissions
- Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Navigate to your project: `woO7tVLT1thaCA91b578RM`
- Check if you have **Owner** or **Admin** role on this project
- If you don't have sufficient permissions, ask the project owner to grant them

### 2. Verify Edge Functions are Enabled
- In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Edge Functions** tab
- Ensure Edge Functions are available for your plan (may require Pro plan)
- Check if there are any billing issues preventing deployment

### 3. Clear Cache and Retry
- Clear your browser cache
- Log out and log back into Supabase dashboard
- Try deploying again from the Figma Make interface

### 4. Manual Deployment (Alternative)
If the above doesn't work, you can deploy manually:

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Deploy the edge function
supabase functions deploy make-server --project-ref woO7tVLT1thaCA91b578RM
```

### 5. Check Service Role Key
- Go to Settings > API in your Supabase dashboard
- Ensure the `service_role` key is properly configured
- The key should have full permissions to deploy functions
